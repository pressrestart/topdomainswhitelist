# Top Domains for Whitelisting

This project provides a curated list of the most commonly used domains that users may want to whitelist on their routers. The list is intended for those who prefer to block access to all websites except the ones they use the most. This can be useful for parental control, productivity, or minimalistic internet setups. Only primary domains are listed for simplicity.
This list was originally made to be used with [adblock-lean](https://github.com/lynxthecat/adblock-lean) but you are free to use it with whatever setup you have.

## Why Whitelist?

Whitelisting allows users to block all internet traffic except to specific domains. By creating a whitelist, you ensure that only the most necessary websites and services are accessible. This method can improve focus, reduce distractions, and help manage screen time effectively.
