# Top 100 most visited sites in the US for Whitelisting

This project provides a curated list of the Top 100 most visited websites in the US, designed for users who want to enhance their privacy and security by restricting access to only trusted sites. By whitelisting these commonly used domains, you can block all other websites, significantly reducing exposure to potential security threats, malware, and invasive tracking. This approach creates a more secure and controlled browsing environment, ideal for purposes like parental control, safeguarding sensitive data, and maintaining a streamlined, privacy-focused internet setup. 

Whitelisting allows you to limit access to verified domains, minimizing the risk of phishing attacks and other online threats. It also helps protect your privacy by restricting data shared with less trustworthy sites. Additionally, this method can boost focus, reduce distractions, and manage screen time effectively. Originally created for use with [adblock-lean](https://github.com/lynxthecat/adblock-lean), this list is flexible and can be used with any security or filtering setup to create a safer and more controlled digital experience.

## allowlist_kids
A list of the 25 most visited websites that are safe and educational for children. By whitelisting these domains, parents can ensure a secure online environment, allowing kids to explore valuable resources and engage in interactive learning while minimizing exposure to inappropriate content.

## allowlist_nsfw
The 4 NSFW sites from the US top 100 are included in case you'd like to whitelist or blacklist them.

## Countries
In the countries directory, you'll find allowlists for the top 10 websites in the 30 countries with the largest number of users globally. These lists exclude US-based websites like Google, Amazon, and Apple, focusing instead on country-specific sites.

## CDNs and APIs
Websites such as Cloudfront, Cloudflare, and googleapis.com will not be globally whitelisted due to their potential to host malicious software, advertisements, or other harmful content. Instead, each CDN server and googleapis domain will be added as a subdomain tailored to the specific requirements of individual websites, thereby enhancing overall security. For instance, there have been reports of storage.googleapis.com being exploited for malicious purposes. This project's approach prevents that.
