# Top Domains for Whitelisting

This project provides a curated list of the [most commonly used domains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-visited_websites) that users may want to whitelist on their routers. The list is intended for those who prefer to block access to all websites except the ones they use the most. This can be useful for parental control, productivity, or minimalistic internet setups. Only primary domains are listed for simplicity.
This list was originally made to be used with [adblock-lean](https://github.com/lynxthecat/adblock-lean) but you are free to use it with whatever setup you have.

## Why Whitelist?

Whitelisting allows users to block all internet traffic except to specific domains. This enhances security by minimizing exposure to potentially harmful websites. By restricting access to only trusted domains, you reduce the risk of malware, phishing attacks, and other online threats. Furthermore, this approach promotes privacy, as it limits the data shared with less reputable sites. Not having access to every single website or IP address in the world can be beneficial, as it creates a more controlled and secure online environment, ultimately safeguarding sensitive information and maintaining user privacy.
This method can also improve focus, reduce distractions, and help manage screen time effectively.
